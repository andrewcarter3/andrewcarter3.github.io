<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
