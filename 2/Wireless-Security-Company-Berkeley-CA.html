<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

Our company believe alarm systems work best when incorporated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control.

The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
