Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
