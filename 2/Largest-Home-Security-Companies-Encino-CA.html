<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by.
