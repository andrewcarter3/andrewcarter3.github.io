<p>The length of time does it generally take to turn to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May transfer to cellular eventually in the future but staying with dial-up for now. Of course, you may wish to think of acquiring a security camera or two to accompany your system, however choosing the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little more costly than Frontpoint's a lot of basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% promotional offer), which does not include a camera.</p>
