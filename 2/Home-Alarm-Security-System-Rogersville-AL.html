<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range concerns.</p>
<p>For the a lot of part, wireless security equipment is only as noticeable as you want it to be.
