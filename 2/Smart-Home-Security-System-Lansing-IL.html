<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to store and for how long you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
<p>Some wireless security service providers have extra functions and prepare for an added cost.

For instance, Scout just uses one security camera (and it's for indoor use just). If you desire a few more sets of eyes on your residential or commercial property, however, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion notifications to your Scout app.</p>
