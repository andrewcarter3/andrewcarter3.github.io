Look for a camera that supports updated wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never ever install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>

Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of recording storage area.
