The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an infraction. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
