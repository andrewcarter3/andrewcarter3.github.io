<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
