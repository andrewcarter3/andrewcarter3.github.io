<h3>CCTV Home Security System in Missouri</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>There are two outdoor security camera styles - dome or bullet-shaped. The dome-shaped outdoor security camera is understood to be less apparent to unwanted visitors since they offer a 360 swivel that makes it hard to determine their instructions.
