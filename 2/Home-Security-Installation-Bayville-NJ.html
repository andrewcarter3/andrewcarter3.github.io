<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
