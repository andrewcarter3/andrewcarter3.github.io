<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things.

Eventually, he cautions, "people might find out to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers."
