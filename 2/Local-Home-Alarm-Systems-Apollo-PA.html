As with their indoor equivalents, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and permit you to view live video from your phone.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
