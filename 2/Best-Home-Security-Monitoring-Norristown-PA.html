<h2>Monitored Burglar Alarm Norristown</h2>
<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has actually acquired rather the excitement over the years. We have actually been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the free self-monitor" option.</p>

It makes no sense that we don't have equivalent laws for video recording. Wireless security systems use radio frequency (RF) or in some cases Wi-Fi connections to link security sensing units to the total system. Z-Wave and Zigbee are a few of the more common wireless innovations used by significant security companies. Here are a couple of things wireless systems provide over standard hardwired systems.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses additional info that might never ever have been possible before, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, going into the building. An image of that staff member is presented on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating takes place.</p>
