Another great function of the YI Dome Camera is unrestricted totally free cloud storage.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
