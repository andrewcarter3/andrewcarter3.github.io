It also has add-ons such as a camera, a doorbell camera, smoke alarms, and extra sensors. Unlike the Ring Alarm, nevertheless, it does not offer self-monitoring choices or outdoor cameras; you likewise can't add any non-SimpliSafe devices, and live customer support is offered just from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern.</p>
