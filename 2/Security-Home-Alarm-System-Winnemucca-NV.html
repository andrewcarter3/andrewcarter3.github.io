<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>You're in the eye of the public when you're in a public area. So what's the distinction in being watched by a closed circuit TV camera?

Yes, a video surveillance camera in public locations is good - it helps in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent. Post criminal activity investigation is simple and catching culprits is easy for law-enforcement officers.</p>
