<p>Many home security systems use additional sensors that supply protection beyond staying out intruders. These sensors assist you protect your home from things like floods and freezing temperatures.

<p>The Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is created to provide HD video with a 4K HDR sensing unit and a vast array of vision with a 140-degree field of vision. Unlike many cameras, this Vivint outdoor camera includes deterrence features: a red LED light and a caution tone. The LED light will turn on and the warning tone will sound through the camera's 85 db speakers if a lurker is determined on your property by the camera. As with most cameras, you'll get activity notices with the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and people. Since carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, the only method to monitor harmful levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Thankfully, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your house increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also get push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you know there is an issue, even when you're not in your home.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense prevention designed to prevent both personal and home criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out too much. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your house. The second crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it works as a home alarm system along with a security camera. That separates it from the items I've already written, and helps in part to explain its rate.</p>
