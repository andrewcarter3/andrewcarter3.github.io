<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
