<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small charge. We recommend the eight-piece kit due to the fact that it includes several windows and door sensors for complete coverage. We likewise suggest adding a doorbell camera at some point.
