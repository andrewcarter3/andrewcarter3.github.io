<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
