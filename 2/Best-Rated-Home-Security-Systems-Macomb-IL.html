The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller, but the range is much better, promising connections to wireless sensing units up to 800 feet away.

<p>Advantages: low rate of incorrect alarms, very reputable sensing units, and high rate of detection. My Alarm Center's packages are powered by high-quality equipment.

More advanced packages consist of email and text informs, remote gain access to through mobile devices and computer systems, thermostat and lighting control, and smart scheduling.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
