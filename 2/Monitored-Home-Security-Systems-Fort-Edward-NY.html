<p>We have updated hundreds of old analog CCTV systems with HD CCTV systems. This upgrade can be made complex and trigger lots of problems and cash waste. We design HD CCTV systems for brand new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a group of specialist specialists here with years of hands on experience. When we indicate "hands on experience", we imply climbing up the ladder, running cables, screening security cameras of all sorts and the entire nine backyards that you will have to do to install security camera systems. When it comes to security cameras, we are more like Home Depot. We have the proficiency when you need to decide in between brands, innovations, items.</p>
<p>For smart home functions, we advise the ADT Pulse package. It provides full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you remotely arm and disarm your system, turn lights and other electronics on and off, and control the thermostat so you never need to come home to a cold house. ADT also deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can control your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful citizens with smartphones is better security than one security person viewing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
