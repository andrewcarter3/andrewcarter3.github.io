<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR.

There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
