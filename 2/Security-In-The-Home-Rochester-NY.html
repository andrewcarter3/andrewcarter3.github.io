<p>The videos your camera records most likely will not be saved money on the camera itself. Many home security cameras use cloud services to save and offer remote access to video Some designs have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you wish to examine footage, but this is an unusual function. Still, if innovation has actually made us vulnerable, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pushing tough to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera area.

The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
