Obviously, you might want to consider purchasing a security camera or more to accompany your system, but choosing the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little more pricey than Frontpoint's most basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which does not include a camera.</p>
