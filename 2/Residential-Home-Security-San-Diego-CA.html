<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational crime avoidance designed to avoid both individual and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<h3>Alarm System Installation San Diego CA 92154</h3>
<p>The system is an ideal option for organisations and homes, featuring optional growth up to eight HD security cameras and full HD 1080p resolution. Alarm monitoring is not only a budget friendly method to protect your home or business from burglary, medical and fire emergency situations, but it might spend for itself! Many insurer offer premium discounts to expertly monitored alarm clients - in some cases up to 20% off. Across 76 research studies, Piza and associates (2019) found that closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance had a statistically significant influence on total criminal offense (OR = 1.14). This implies that the chances of general crime happening in the treatment locations with CCTV were reduced by 14 percent compared to the control areas that had no surveillance.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
