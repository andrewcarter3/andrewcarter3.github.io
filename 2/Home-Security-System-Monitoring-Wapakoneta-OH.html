<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
