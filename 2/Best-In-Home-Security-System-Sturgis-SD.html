Due to the fact that everything is merely stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, removing cameras, detectors, and other elements of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new location takes minutes, not days. Wireless systems are the method to go if you lease and move frequently.</p>

It would false alarm every time you walked into a protected space if the system worked any other method.</p>
