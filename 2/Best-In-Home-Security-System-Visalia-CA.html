For years, Macs were thought to be immune to viruses and were rarely targeted by cybercriminals because they represented such a small percentage of the individual computing world compared to millions of Windows users.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All things produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an item is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can identifying small differences in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
