<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being seen understand they're being seen, and you can choose to record video clips or photos and conserve them to your wise gadget on a whim.</p>
