<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home elements in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more flexible. Contact sensing units are the very first thing you need to buy together with the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will inform you when they open.

It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
