That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with nifty smart home features. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

Just a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names using expensive, stiff strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all changed.</p>
