<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which means you can utilize several different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant devices. Our company believe alarm systems work best when incorporated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control. That way when a door is opened, or a camera is gone by, you will look out. Typically, the bullet CCTV camera type is small, which could be 2.5 to 3 inches long decided by the CCTV camera lens types.

<p>It's becoming more popular. However for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that provides two-way audio, go all out.
