This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space.
