<p>Because it's more complicated than it ought to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
