<p>B. The owner will make sure all burglar alarm systems are kept per maker requirements and adopted codes. The camera's seeing angle figures out how much area the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses minimize the number of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, however the very best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or better. After checking out the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they've partnered with another security company and their starter package I think starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so all in all a good deal.</p>

<p>We needed guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to secure the line camping tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating unit at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he could look at the whole location and speak to me about my concerns. He was expert, very reassuring and polite. The 2nd guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the event began, he was also professional, comforting and courteous. We were very happy with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
