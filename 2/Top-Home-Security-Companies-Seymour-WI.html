<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop.
