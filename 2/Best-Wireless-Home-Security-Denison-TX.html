Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
