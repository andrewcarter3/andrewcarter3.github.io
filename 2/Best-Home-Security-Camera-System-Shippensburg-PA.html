The Ring Floodlight Cam combines 2 necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
