The regulation needs monitored burglar alarms in unincorporated Douglas County, the city of Castle Pines and the town of Larkspur to be registered and pay an annual $40 license cost. The alarm installation or monitoring company, not the home owner or entrepreneur, is required to sign up the alarm and pay the fee. Burglar alarms are meant to prevent burglary and to help cops capture intruders, which, if done reliably and efficiently, benefits the public at large. If, nevertheless, alarm systems are inefficient or undependable, the drain on authorities resources from responding to them may exceed their advantages.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible offenders are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being seen or have a higher risk of being apprehended. This is also called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the culprit needs to be aware of the included surveillance for it to achieve its wanted effect.</p>
<p>The charges were set following careful analysis of response costs when an alarm activates (despite whether the alarm activation was incorrect). In 2002, more than 98 percent of the dispatched alarm requires cops action were considered incorrect. In 2001, more than 75 percent of the dispatched alarm calls for fire action were considered false, unintentional, or a system malfunction. Historically the costs of these responses have been paid by the City's basic fund. Seattle estimates the charges will recuperate more than $1.8 million in City expenses that were formerly absorbed by basic taxpayers.</p>
