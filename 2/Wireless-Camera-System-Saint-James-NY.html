<p>Local storage: Some cameras include memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can keep video right on the device.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
