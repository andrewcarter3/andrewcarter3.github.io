If you're starting from scratch, we 'd probably advise a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
