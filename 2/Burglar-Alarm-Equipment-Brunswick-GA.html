<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government agents tends to deter things.

They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
