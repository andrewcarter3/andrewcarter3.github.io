The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
