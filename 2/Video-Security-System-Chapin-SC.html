The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
