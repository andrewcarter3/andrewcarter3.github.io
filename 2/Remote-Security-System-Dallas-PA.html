<p>Arlo builds great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of.

<p>Many home security systems are managed by smart devices and that trend will continue. Systems will have fewer wall-mounted keypads, and rather, offer more controls to more devices. Wireless door, window, glass break, water, freeze and motion sensing units communicate with a hub or base station in your home. The main control should be centrally located in your house and have full-time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm systems are extremely trusted and you don't need to worry about their battery running out. However, they are repaired in place, may require professional installation, and they're not portable.</p>
