<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
