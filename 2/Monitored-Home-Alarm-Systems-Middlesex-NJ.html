<p>The loudest of the wise alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anybody in your home and those nearby that there's an issue. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we like that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be gotten used to account for family pets, too. The alarm is just one of two we checked that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more preventing anyone from trying to break in to your home.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
