<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and government centers, and residential clients. After looking into 4 different security systems, we picked SSA. They offered us the very best description of their services and offered us more for the cash. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a truly expert installation should be. We feel very safe understanding our home is secured by SSA. The New Providence Police Department is committed to utilizing every resource to avoid and resolve crimes and to protect citizens and their residential or commercial property.

We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
