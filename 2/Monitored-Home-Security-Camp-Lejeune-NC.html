<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, typically prevent making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be established at different properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.
