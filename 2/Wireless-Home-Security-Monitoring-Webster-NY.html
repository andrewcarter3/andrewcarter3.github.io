The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
