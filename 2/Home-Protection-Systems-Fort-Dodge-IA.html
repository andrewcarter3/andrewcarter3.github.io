<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
