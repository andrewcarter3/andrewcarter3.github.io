<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
