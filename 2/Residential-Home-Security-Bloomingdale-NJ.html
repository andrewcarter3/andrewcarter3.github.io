<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
