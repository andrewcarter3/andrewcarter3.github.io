<p>Home security should never be restricted by where you can place or power your cameras, inside or outdoors. The Ring Base Station lets you link Ring Alarm parts so that you can monitor them through the Ring App. The Ring Base Station also integrates with Alexa-enabled gadgets.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines wail, felines squeal, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
