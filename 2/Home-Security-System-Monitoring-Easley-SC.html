<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings.
