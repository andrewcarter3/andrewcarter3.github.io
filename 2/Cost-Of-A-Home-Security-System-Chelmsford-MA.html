With smart sensing units, you and your pet can remain secured without fear of incorrect alarms. It is better to have a different computer system (server) for uploading video to the cloud.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
