For many years, Macs were thought to be immune to viruses and were rarely targeted by cybercriminals due to the fact that they represented such a small percentage of the individual computing world compared to countless Windows users.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
