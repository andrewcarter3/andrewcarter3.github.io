<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors sometimes) and sounds an alarm with an expert monitoring company.

Then, the monitoring company immediately sets to action, connecting with you and notifying the authorities.</p>
