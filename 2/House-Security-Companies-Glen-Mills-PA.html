<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature.

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
