<p>The 2nd main difference is the rates. Wired systems can be notoriously costly. Every element of the system will cost you cash. So, at the end, who's robbing who? With prices so high, it typically isn't worth it for property owners to have actually a wired security system unless their budget is wide enough to fit the system comfortably.

<p>A professionally monitored system is viewed by an alarm company from a monitoring center. The company contacts the homeowner and the authorities if there's a problem. If the property owner verifies there isn't an emergency, police aren't called. If the property owner can't be reached, the company accesses the scenario and can call the cops if needed. House owners pay for a security system to be expertly monitored. There's a regular monthly monitoring charge that generally ranges in between $15-40 a month.</p>
