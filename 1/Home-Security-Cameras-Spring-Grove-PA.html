Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by.
