<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
