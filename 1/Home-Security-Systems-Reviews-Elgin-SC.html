<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Maximus Smart Security Light: If you want a subtle security camera, the Maximus Smart Security Light fits the expense. The camera's not especially impressive on its own, but its porchlight outside will look much better than your other choices.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
