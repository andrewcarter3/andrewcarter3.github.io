<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated clever home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
