ADT utilizes an independent supplier design including third-party dealers. The dealerships identify which equipment to use. Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that use full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly choice.</p>
