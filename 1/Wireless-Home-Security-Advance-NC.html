<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
