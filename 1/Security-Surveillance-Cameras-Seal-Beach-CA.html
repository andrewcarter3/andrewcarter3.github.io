<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard clever home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for would-be bundle burglars or talk with visitors who stop by.</p>

The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so overall a great deal.</p>

The greatest consideration when picking which kind of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next consideration is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
