The second classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, normally starts at about $400 (US) per camera-- a substantially higher price. The video recorder should be purchased individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (US $) and can vary as much as $5000 depending on the quantity of storage, camera connection, and image processing features.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
