<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
