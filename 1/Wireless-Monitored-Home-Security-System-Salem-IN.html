<p>There are two primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern iteration of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a little bit more expensive, they offer a variety of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a take a look at the distinctions between the 2 kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be. Nevertheless, they are still based on interference and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is secured.</p>

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
