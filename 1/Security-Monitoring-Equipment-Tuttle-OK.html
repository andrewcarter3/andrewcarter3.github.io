<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
