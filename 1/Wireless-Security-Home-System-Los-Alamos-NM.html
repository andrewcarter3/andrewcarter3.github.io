Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
