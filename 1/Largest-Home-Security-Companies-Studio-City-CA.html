<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. Select either landline or the proper interactive service if using 4G LTE cellular or IP Web. Select billing duration: Yearly or month-to-month. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our yearly customers.

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious.
