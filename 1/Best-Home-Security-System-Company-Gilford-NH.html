<h3>Burglar Alarm Equipment in Gilford NH</h3>
<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually located in the entryway hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, wise alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and informs you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours).
