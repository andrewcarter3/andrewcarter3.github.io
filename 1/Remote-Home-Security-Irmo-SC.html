<h3>Home Security Surveillance Cameras in South Carolina</h3>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
