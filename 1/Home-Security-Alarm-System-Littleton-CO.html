<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the maker's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt.

If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range problems.</p>
