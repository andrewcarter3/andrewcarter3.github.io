<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
