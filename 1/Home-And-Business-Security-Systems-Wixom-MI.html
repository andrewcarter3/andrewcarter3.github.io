<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's initial award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems provide impressive, trustworthy home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, but that greater cost includes a system that is smaller sized, quicker, and stronger. At half the size of the initial system, the small sensors are almost invisible. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten intruders.</p>

For instance, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp inside your home or trigger an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
