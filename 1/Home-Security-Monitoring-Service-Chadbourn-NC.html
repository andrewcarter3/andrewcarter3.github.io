<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and use two AA batteries that can last as much as two years. Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
