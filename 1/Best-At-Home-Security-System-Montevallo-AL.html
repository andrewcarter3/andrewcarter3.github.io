<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on developed to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable.
