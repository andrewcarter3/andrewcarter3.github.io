<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of taping storage space. A lot, in reality, that they require about four times the hard disk area of 1080p to record the exact same length of video footage.
