<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
