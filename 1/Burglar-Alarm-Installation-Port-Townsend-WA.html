Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
