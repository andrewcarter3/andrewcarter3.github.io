The system is based on electro-magnetic or coaxial sensing unit cable television with the controller having the ability to separate in between signals from the cable television or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad climate condition.</p>

Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
