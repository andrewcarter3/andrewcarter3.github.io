A lot of cameras with recording capabilities have an integrated secure digital (SD) or microSD slot that enables sufficient tape-recording space. When the sd card is complete, you'll need to delete video footage or shop it elsewhere. Some popular cameras instantly override expired videos, which may not be most perfect if you need to keep a video.
