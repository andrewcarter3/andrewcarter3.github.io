<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which suggests. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
