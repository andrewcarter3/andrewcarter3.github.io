The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the destructive opponent to record these codes and use various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential recorded throughout the network healing.</p>
