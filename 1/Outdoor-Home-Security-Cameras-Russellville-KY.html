<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
