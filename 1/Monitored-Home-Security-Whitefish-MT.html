However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and ineffective  method to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
