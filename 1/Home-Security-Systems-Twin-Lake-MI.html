The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems available today.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas.
