<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
