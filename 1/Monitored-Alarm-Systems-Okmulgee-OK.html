<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
