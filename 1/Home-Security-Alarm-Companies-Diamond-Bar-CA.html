<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
