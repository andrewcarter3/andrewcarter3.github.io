The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
