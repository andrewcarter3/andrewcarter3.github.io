<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring Pleasant Prairie WI 53158</h3>
<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  approach to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
