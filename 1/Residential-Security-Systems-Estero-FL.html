<p>View clear 720p video in seconds and manage your system from throughout the world using the free Zmodo app. HDMI connection uses local monitor viewing, and simple internet setup guarantees you're informed no matter where you go. Everybody needs to know that at some time electronics will fail, fall off, or simply end up being out-of-date.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a normal camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to fix detail after the truth, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of taping storage space. So much, in fact, that they need about four times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
