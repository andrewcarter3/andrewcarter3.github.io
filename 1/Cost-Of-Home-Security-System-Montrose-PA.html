ELERTS is a complimentary mobile phone app that enables citizens who see something suspicious to take a photo and quickly send it to public safety officials.

Reports from smart phone users can be quickly evaluated and acted on by Public Safety authorities.</p>

Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
