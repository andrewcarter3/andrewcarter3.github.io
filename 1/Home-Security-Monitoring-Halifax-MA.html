<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and fraud. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

<p>When you're in a public area, you remain in the eye of the public. So what's the distinction in being enjoyed by a closed circuit TV camera?

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same person could place a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
