<p>Wireless home security systems require batteries. For that reason, you will have to examine and change the batteries occasionally, which takes more effort, cash, and time.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
