Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
