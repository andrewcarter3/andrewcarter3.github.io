<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out excessive. Pretty easy to install.

The 2nd crucial thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably raucous built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.
