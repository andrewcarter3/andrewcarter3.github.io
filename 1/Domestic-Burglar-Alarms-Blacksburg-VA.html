What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually observed some improvements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and upgrade this review, as needed.</p>

<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it includes person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, fewer incorrect informs.
