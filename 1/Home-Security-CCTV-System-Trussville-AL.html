ELERTS is a complimentary mobile phone app that enables residents who see something suspicious to take an image and quickly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider may observe somebody behaving suspiciously. Many individuals are messing, surfing or texting with their mobile devices.

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.
