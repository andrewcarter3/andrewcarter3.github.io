<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. A lot, in truth, that they need about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>

Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.
