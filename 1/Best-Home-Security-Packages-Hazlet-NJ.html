<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
