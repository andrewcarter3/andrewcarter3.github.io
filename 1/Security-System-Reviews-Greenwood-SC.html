It resembles having your own individual guard patrolling your home all the time.</p>
<p>The first (and most obvious, for sure) part of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your specific requirements and budget plan; are you putting them inside your home or outdoors? Is 1080P a large enough resolution? Will they have the ability to see and tape-record video effectively in low-lighting? Are they positioned with appropriate field of vision, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are all important questions to be considered when selecting security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>

It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
