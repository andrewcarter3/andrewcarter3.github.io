<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on developed to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
