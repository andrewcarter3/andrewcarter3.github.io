<p>Dependability is an extremely subjective when it comes to innovation matter, depending on which functions and advantages a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and poor connection are still typical problems. Hardwired systems need minimal upkeep, and short of a basic power interruption, are harder to disrupt.
