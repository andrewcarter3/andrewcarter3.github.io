<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  approach to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
