<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings.
