During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather simple to set up and utilize-- but not quite as easy as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most economical monitoring plan starting at $10. You can get all the fundamentals like sms, push, and email informs, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's least expensive, Always On" strategy. However, you will have to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this does not come with expert monitoring. This extra cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take.</p>
<p>Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we enjoy its wise monitoring alerts. It features HD live streaming, motion alerts, night vision, a decent app and, most importantly, 14 days of free motion-based cloud storage. This Wyze camera likewise features an integrated microSD card if you wish to go the local storage path.
