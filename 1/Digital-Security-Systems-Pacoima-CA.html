<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It also means that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might quickly tape a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would be enough to send even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway.</p>
<p>Lots of home security systems are controlled by smart devices which pattern will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, give more controls to more devices.

The primary control should be centrally situated in your home and have full-time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm are exceptionally trustworthy and you don't need to fret about their battery going out. However, they are fixed in location, may need expert installation, and they're not portable.</p>
