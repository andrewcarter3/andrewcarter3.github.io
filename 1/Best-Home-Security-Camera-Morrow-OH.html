<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential consumers. After looking into 4 different security systems, we picked SSA. They gave us the very best description of their services and provided us more for the money.

We feel really safe knowing our home is secured by SSA. The New Providence Police Department is devoted to making use of every resource to avoid and solve crimes and to safeguard people and their property.

<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were very helpful and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we desired, and they performed with professionalism and skills. I'm uncertain if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially in the evening when weather conditions truly mess with the night vision.

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription.
