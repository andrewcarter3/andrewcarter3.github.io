<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the precise very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
