First and foremost, wireless security systems provide the apparent advantage of simpler installation over their wired equivalents, but the benefits don't stop there.

<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the fact, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more money.</p>
<p>That potential flaw aside, the Arlo Q provided sharp and colorful 130-degree video and still images, in both bright and dim light, even when utilizing the 8 x digital zoom. The night mode produced exceptionally crisp images, but they didn't look as intense as the Logitech Circle 2's. Nevertheless, using the SimpliSafe mobile app needs a paid monitoring strategy.
