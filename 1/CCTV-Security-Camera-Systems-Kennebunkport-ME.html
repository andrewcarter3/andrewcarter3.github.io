<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may discover to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
