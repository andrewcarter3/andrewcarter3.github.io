<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.
