Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

This makes it possible to get notifications concerning anything peculiar your cameras records-- such as movement inside your business at 3:00 am-- and view it live from anywhere via a computer system or mobile phone. The major drawback of IP cameras is their greater price.</p>
