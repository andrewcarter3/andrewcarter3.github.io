<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensing units, access control, and so on.
