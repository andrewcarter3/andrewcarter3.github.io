<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that items are seldom precisely the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
